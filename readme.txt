Easily manage events and sell tickets on your WordPress site. Sugar Calendar is easy-to-use, reliable, and exceptionally powerful. See for yourself.

== Description ==

We believe that it should be easy to manage events on your website! Sugar Calendar will quickly and easily enable you to do that.

Would you like to sell tickets for your events? No problem, Sugar Calendar has you covered with a Stripe integration for our Event Ticketing feature, which you can use in the free version of our plugin!

Most event calendar plugins are either way too simple, or overly complex and bloated. Sugar Calendar is lightweight and provides the major features you need for event management.
